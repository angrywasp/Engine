#### Unit Tests

Unit tests use 3D models from these repositories:

- https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Models.git
- https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Blender-Exporter.git
- https://github.com/bghgary/glTF-Asset-Generator.git
- https://github.com/BabylonJS/MeshesLibrary.git

**WARNING:** The _first time_ your run the tests will clone the repositories into the _target bin folder_;
The sample models repository is ~2gb, so it takes a while to download, a perfect time to have a coffee.
